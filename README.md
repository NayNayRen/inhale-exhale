This is a project that could be used to help breathing and relaxation.

Modifications were made from the original creation, built by Brad Traversy of Traversy Media, when following along in a titorial.

I also added responsive media queries for multiple screen sizes, and switched up the color scheme.

The stack used is HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript.

I appreciate you stopping by.
