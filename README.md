## About Just Breathe

This is a project that could be used to help breathing and relaxation.

The original app was a
<a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank">udemy.com</a>
project that I had worked along with. I switched up a few things like the color scheme, backgrounds for
desktop and mobile,
the inhale/exhale timing and the overall page layout. It's a nice little breathing exercise.

I also added responsive media queries for mobile screen sizes.
